      <strong>Beyond the 4% Rule: Flexible Withdrawals Under Risk Aversion</strong><br><br>
      Bill Bengen's famous 4% rule provides a simple, effective retirement strategy: invest in a 50/50 stock-bond mix, withdraw 4% of your initial portfolio per year, and increase annually for inflation. Historically you won't run out of money over 30 years. <br><br>
      This represents an infinite risk aversion solution—a hard constraint that never allows withdrawals to decrease or the portfolio to run dry.<br><br>
      But what if we relaxed that constraint? What flexible rules would emerge at different levels of risk tolerance?
      In a March 2021 article for <a href="https://advisorperspectives.com/articles/2021/03/22/beyond-the-4-rule-flexible-withdrawal-strategies-using-certainty-equivalent-spending" target="_blank">Advisor Perspectives</a>, I maximized certainty-equivalent spending under constant relative risk aversion (CRRA)—essentially, actual spending discounted by its volatility based on your risk preference. Using gradient-free Python optimization frameworks on historical data, I generated rules of the form:<br><br>
      <em>Withdraw = fixed_pct + (variable_pct × portfolio_value), subject to a floor_pct minimum</em><br><br>
      As risk aversion increases, stock allocation decreases and the withdrawal rule shifts from variable to fixed. This framework lets retirees choose their preferred point on the risk-return spectrum, perhaps tolerating some risk of future modest declines in spending for higher current and expected lifetime spending.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p><strong>I build and ship production AI systems for investment management.</strong> For more than three decades, I've worked at the intersection of markets, technology, and decision-making—designing and operating systems that PMs and investment teams rely on. My background spans front-office roles, hedge-fund CTO leadership, and hands-on AI engineering, including work at Tiger Management, Caxton, and as CTO of a $2B Tiger Cub fund.</p>

<p>Today, <strong>I help hedge funds and investment firms plan and implement AI strategy,</strong> translating modern AI capabilities into production systems that improve execution velocity, decision quality, and operational efficiency. </p>

<p>Many AI projects struggle and fail. Key reasons include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lack of business-centric framing and success metrics</li>
  <li>Lack of realistic evals against business objectives</li>
  <li>Misaligned expectations</li>
  <li>Lack of end user or executive buy-in</li>
  <li>Governance, risk, and compliance blind spots</li>
  <li>Automating too little or too much, with poorly tuned human-in-the-loop dynamics</li>
</ul>

<p>I can help avoid those pitfalls.</p>

<p><strong>Recent successes include:</strong>

        <ul>
            <li>Designing and deploying RAG-based research summarization, text-to-SQL on CRM data, and agentic workflows for sell-side and buy-side teams.</li>
            <li>Architecting agent automation systems using OpenAI Agents SDK and LangGraph.</li>
            <li>Traditional ML for alternative data signals</li>
        </ul>

<p>As CTO of Hoplite Capital Management (2008–2010), I was the first internal tech hire at a 25-person, $2B AUM long/short equity fund. I built a best-practice end-to-end platform, including OMS (Eze Castle), real-time P&L and portfolio analytics, FIX trading, compliance, post-trade workflows, and disaster recovery, supporting daily decision-making for PMs and analysts.</p>

<p>Earlier, I led hedge fund implementations at Charles River Development, and held front-office roles at Caxton and Tiger Management. I began my career at Salomon Brothers, doing economic forecasting and building portfolio optimization systems using multi-factor risk models.</p>

<p><strong>Technical focus:</strong> Python, AI-assisted full SDLC dev practices, agentic systems, LangChain/LangGraph, OpenAI Agents SDK, RAG, robust data pipelines.</p>
