<p>So people like Mitt Romney, and all his heirs in perpetuity, would never pay another dime in income tax. How sweet is that? How fair is that?</p>

<p>It’s shocking that in this day and age, someone could make such a proposal, and be considered a serious person and politician.</p>

<p>The GOP has come an awful long way from its founder, who said, <em>“Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration.”</em> – Abraham Lincoln</p>
