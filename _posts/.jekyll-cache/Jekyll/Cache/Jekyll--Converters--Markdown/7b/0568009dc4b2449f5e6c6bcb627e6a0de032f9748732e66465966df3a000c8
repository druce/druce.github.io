I"<p>Hereâ€™s a fun little update of that <a href="/2016/05/the-top-100-people-to-follow-to-discover-financial-news-on-twitter-april-2016/">visualization of the financial Twittersphere I posted in May</a>. This one is in 3D, you can zoom (with scroll wheel) and drag it around (with mouse, also see controls in top right).</p>

<p>It might take a minute to load up, not work too well on older computers/browsers. Just wait out/ignore any popups, warnings about script on page running slowly. If the iframe below is wonky, try <a href="https://plot.ly/~drucev/94/network-of-follows/">this full-page version</a>.<br />
<!--more--></p>

<p>More followed accounts are in larger font. People in similar regions and similar colors are followed by similar people and tend to follow each other. (Divided the graph into 5 regions of similar folks using a clustering algorithm and colored accordingly.)</p>

<p>At some point will do a more complete data science-y post on the Twittersphere graph, but still exploring fun stuff one can do with the data.</p>
