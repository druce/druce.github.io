  <li>The report that taught me the most this week is <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/11/russian-lawyer-natalia-veselnitskaya-interview-240393">this interview with Natalia Veselnitskaya</a>. The Russians have decided Trump is worth more dead than alive. If that’s not the case this interview doesn’t happen. [Edit: <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/russian-american-lobbyist-just-strolled-trump-jr-meeting-212151832.html">Others also seem oddly talkative.</a>]</li>
  <li>Mixed reports on Veselnitskaya: <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/07/13/537082081/businessman-bill-browder-details-dealings-with-russian-laywer-tied-to-trump">Browder</a>, who would know, says she’s Russia’s point person on Magnitsky Act sanctions; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-11/trump-s-low-level-russian-connection">Bershedsky</a> says she’s a nobody, more like an AG Schneiderman repping some local oligarchs than a Kremlin power broker; Ioffe says she’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/07/russian-crown-prosecutor/533295/?utm_source=atltw">connected</a>.</li>
  <li>Bottom line, if Putin doesn’t want her to throw Don Trump, Jr. under a bus, it doesn’t happen. She is in a position to know that interview serves her patrons.</li>
  <li>Veselnitskaya went to Trump Tower, said Russia can help…But first, are you going to lift sanctions and let oligarchs move money around free from worries about seizure? That’s what Russia is talking about when they talk about adoptions and sanctions. (Edit: she brought along a <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/rinat-akmetshin-russia-gun-for-hire-washington-lobbying-magnitsky-browder/27863265.html">Russian ex (?) GRU specialist</a> in <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/mining-company-sayslaw-firm-hacked-it/">hacking dirty tricks</a>.</li>
  <li>So then what happened? Hardly likely that was the end of the matter, given subsequent events: multiple hacks; Trump harping on emails, being very solicitous of Putin; the untimely <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-peter-smith-death-met-0713-20170713-story.html">demised</a> Mr. Smith <a href="https://lawfareblog.com/time-i-got-recruited-collude-russians">tracking down hackers</a> who might have had Hillary’s emails; meetings with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kislyak+meetings&amp;oq=kislyak+meetings&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3j69i59j69i60.2839j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=kislyak+meetings&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=nws">Kislyak</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/opinion/jared-kushner-russia-veb.html?_r=0">VEB</a>, the infamous <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/us/politics/kushner-talked-to-russian-envoy-about-creating-secret-channel-with-kremlin.html">backchannel through Russian communication facilities</a>.</li>
  <li>Trump’s problem is that having taken Russian help, and it being public, he is now no longer in any position to deliver them anything of value.</li>
  <li>Maybe the source of the Don Jr. email was Russia: Manafort was on the email chain, given his Russian connections, he might (recklessly) have inquired about it with some trusted Russian who now has an interest in releasing, or he might be sending a message by releasing it now.</li>
  <li>Maybe the Mueller investigation is about to bear fruit and the plan is to get ahead of it and try to pin it all on Don, Jr., and then have the president pardon him. So incriminating himself could be a feature, not a bug.</li>
  <li>If it didn’t come from Kushner or Manafort, it would have to be someone they or Jr. forwarded it to, or someone who intercepted it, like a US or Russia three-letter agency, or a deep Trump organization mole (I would be tearing out walls Billions-like if I were the Trump IT guy, and it would make my day if a lowly IT guy went Snowden on Trump with an email dump.)</li>
  <li>In any event, the Trump presidency is walking dead. It’s over, in terms of major legislation. Once you’re worth more dead than alive to both Vladimir Putin and Mitch McConnell, your days in office are probably numbered.</li>
  <li>Even a hardened cynic can only be appalled at these events, at the people who still deny or excuse a Russian entanglement, think it’s somehow business as usual for presidential candidates to ally with the KGB/GRU, or that loyalty or expedience makes it worth defending. Or respond with <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/salvadorhernandez/veselnitskaya-conspiracy-theory?utm_term=.ar5LEAQ95q#.bvn5jPRVA4">propaganda</a> that would make Goebbels proud, even if they can’t <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-domain-troll-behind-pro-trump-stunts">pronounce Goebbels</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/us/politics/putin-trump-conservatives.html">If deference to Vladimir Putin</a>, a man credibly accused of <a href="http://http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/11/22/finally-we-know-about-moscow-bombings/">false-flag bomb attacks</a> in his own cities to consolidate power, is the price of keeping the alt-right / tea party on side, and that’s not electoral poison, if not in primaries then in the general elections, maybe there is something to the idea that the West is unwilling to defend its values.</li>
