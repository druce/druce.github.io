<p>So, <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/08/13/obamas-dangerously-heroic-view-of-the-fed/">the Obama Administration is â€˜all-inâ€™ on Summers</a>, despite nearly everyone who hasnâ€™t worked for him (and a number who have) thinking heâ€™s not the best candidate.</p>

<p>The argument: â€˜crisis experience,â€™ and the need for a â€˜steady hand.â€™</p>

<p>Summersâ€™s <a href="http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1999/1101990215_400.jpg">crisis experience</a> is like Inspector Clouseauâ€™s, the master detective who always seems to be at the scene of the crime.<br />

<p>You have to ask yourself, how much were his policies of fostering TBTF banks and an unstable shadow banking system to blame for the biggest financial crisis in 80+ years?</p>

<p>You want a Fed chair committed to building a simpler, more resilient financial system, not one who is going to foster more moral hazard by promising to â€˜handleâ€™ them as they arrive (with â€˜liquidity putsâ€™, bailouts, and bank subsidies).</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a time for a steady hand, and a time for a reformer, and the â€˜steady handâ€™ who helped architect an unstable, fragile system that failed catastrophically isnâ€™t the right guy to fix it.</p>
