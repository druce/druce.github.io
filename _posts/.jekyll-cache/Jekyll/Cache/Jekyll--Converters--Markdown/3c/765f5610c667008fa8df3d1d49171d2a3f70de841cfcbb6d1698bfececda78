<p>Lottery tickets are generally a terrible deal in terms of expected value â€“ the lottery pays out far less in winnings than it receives in ticket sales. It has to pay expenses and show a profit. Then the winner has to pay a big income tax bill.</p>

<p>But occasionally, after no one wins the big prize several drawings in a row, the jackpot gets so big that the expected value is positive.</p>

<p>[Edit 1/7/2016: This is <strike>rare</strike> unrealistic. For instance the current record jackpot is quoted as $800m. <a href="https://www.usamega.com/powerball-jackpot.asp">The lump-sum payout would be only $496m.</a> The odds of winning a single bet is 1/292,201,338. So a $2 bet is only worth $1.69. This disregards the possibility of a split pot, which is significant. If you pay the top Federal tax rate of 39.6%, that $1.69 is only worth $1.02. NYC rate maxes out at 12.7%, bringing the top combined income tax rate to 52.3%, leaving $0.81 per $2 bet.]</p>

<p>You might think that when thereâ€™s positive expected value, itâ€™s a good time to buy a ticket. Actually,Â it turns out thatâ€™s still a losing strategy. Why? Because unless youâ€™re a millionaire, the correct amount to bet is very small. And if youâ€™re not a millionaire, a single ticket is an overbet. You almost always go broke before you hit the jackpot. Paradoxically, even though each individual bet has positive expected value, your expected long-run profit if you bet every week is less than zero.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s the right amount to bet on a risky, but profitable proposition?<br />
<!--more--></p>

<p>Suppose you had access once a day to a â€˜sure thingâ€™ that won 2/3 of the time, and paid $2 when you bet $1. Â And suppose you had $100 to start, and you bet 1$ every day.</p>

<p>You would make $1 a day on average. (2 times out of 3 you would win $2, the third time you would lose $1. You made $3, or $1 a day). If you bet 1% of your bankroll every day, you would make 1% per day. Not bad, but not really maximizing your 100% edge.</p>

<p>Suppose you bet your whole bankroll every day. Your expected value every day is now +$100, instead of $1. But eventually you will lose your whole bankroll, and then you wonâ€™t be able to play again. As time goes to infinity, your expected growth rate approaches zero.</p>

<p>TheÂ <a href="http://home.williampoundstone.net/Kelly/Kelly.html">Kelly Criterion</a>, created by John Kelly in the 50s at Bell Labs,Â tells you how much you should bet to maximize your return. The amount isÂ _edge / odds.Â _Here, the edge is 1 â€“ you win on average, 100% of your bet each day. The odds you are offered are 2:1. Â You should bet 1/2 of your stack each time.</p>

<p>If you do, the following should hold</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your long run growth rate is maximized</li>
  <li>Your long run growth rate is <em>e</em><sup>(1/3) ln(1/2) * (2/3) ln(2)</sup>-1 = 26% per day<br />
(1/3 of the time the outcome is you end up with 1/2 of your bankroll, 2/3 of the time you double your bankroll)</li>
  <li>At any time, you have (1-p) probability of going below fraction p of your bankroll at some point in the future. For example, you have Â a 1/2 chance of losing 1/2 of your bankroll, a 10% chance of losing 90% of your bankroll.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you increase your bet size as a percentage of your capital, initially your expected long-run growth rate goes up linearly, in proportion to your bet size. Eventually, it flattens, and then plummets off a Cliff Of Death toÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler's_ruin">Gamblerâ€™s Ruin</a>. So an optimal strategy is quite volatile and risky. And even if you have a big edge, if you overbet, you go broke.</p>

<p>Now letâ€™s suppose there is a $200m jackpot (in present value, after all expenses and taxes), and you have 1/100m chance of winning.</p>

<p>What is the appropriate amount to bet? The expected value is about 2x the bet. Your edge is about 100%. The odds posted are 200,000,000:1 . So your optimal bet is approximately 1 / 200,000,000 of your stash. If you have $200,000,000, Â you should bet $1, if you have $100,000, you should bet 1/20th of a cent.</p>

<p>What is your expected growth rate if you have $100,000 and you bet $1? Plugging in the formula from 2 above, you are betting .001% of your bankroll, and your expected return is -.000992% (almost the entire bet).</p>

<p>If you make that $1 bet every day for 100,000 days, ie longer than your natural life, more than 999 times out of 1000, you will go broke before you hit that jackpot.</p>

<p>As another illustration â€“ suppose you bet .001% of your net worth on a single ticket in the lottery at those odds (disregarding that in Powerball you canâ€™t put more or less than the price of a ticket on a combo). You do it 2,000,000 times, and then you hit the jackpot â€“ pretty lucky since the odds are 100,000,000 to 1, right? But by the time you hit the jackpot, your bankroll has been so depleted that winning 200m x your bet, you only get back to 41% of your original net worth â€“ because you overbet!</p>

<p>Left as an exercise, at what bankroll your expected return is exactly 0, the Sharpe ratio of the optimal bet.</p>
