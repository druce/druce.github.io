    <p>
      A question for Ben Bernanke at today’s press conference:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &bull; In 2005 at your confirmation hearings, you said there was no housing bubble.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &bull; In 2007, you said the subprime fallout was likely to be contained.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &bull; In 2008, you said you didn’t expect a recession.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &bull; In 2009, you said the Fed would not monetize US government debt.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &bull; In 2010, you said inflation was too low.
    </p>
    
    <p>
