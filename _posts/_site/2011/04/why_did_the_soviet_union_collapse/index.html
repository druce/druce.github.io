<p>A few years old, but new to me: <a href="http://www.aei.org/issue/25991">an interesting perspective from Yegor Gaidar</a>, reformist economist of the post-Gorbachev era.</p>

<p>• Collectivisation and urbanization left the Soviet Union with a grain shortfall. Rather than reform the agricultural sector, they paid for food with oil exports.</p>

<p>• In the 1985, the Saudis decided they would no longer act as swing producer and forgo exports while other members of OPEC cheated. The Saudis started a price war and broke up the cartel. Oil went briefly under $10 a barrel and Soviet oil revenue dried up.</p>

<p>• At first the Soviets paid for food with foreign reserves, then they borrowed. But then they began to reach the limits of their credit.</p>

<p>• Part of Gorbachev’s reforms were with the idea of becoming a country the West would lend to, even provide state guarantees in exchange for reform.</p>

<p>That didn’t work out too well. As Brzezinski later said, the Soviet Union could be an empire or a democracy, but not both. Once they showed weakness, everyone wanted out.</p>
