<p>It is a slow day in a small Irish town. The rain is misting and the streets are deserted.</p>

<p>Times are tough, everybody is in debt, and having a hard time making ends meet, let alone climbing out of debt.</p>

<p>On this particular day a rich German drives into the town, stops at the local hotel and lays a €100 note on the desk, telling the hotel owner he wants to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one to spend the night.</p>

<p>The owner gives him the keys and, as soon as the visitor has walked upstairs, the hotelier grabs the €100 note and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher.</p>

<p>The butcher takes the €100 note and runs down the street to repay his debt to the pig farmer.</p>

<p>The pig farmer takes the €100 note and heads off to pay his bill at the feed co-op.</p>

<p>The guy at the Farmers’ Co-op takes the €100 note and runs to pay his drinks bill at the pub.</p>

<p>The publican slips the money to the local prostitute drinking at the bar, who has fallen on hard times and had to offer her services on credit.</p>

<p>The hooker rushes to the hotel and pays off her room bill to the hotel owner with the €100 note.</p>

<p>The hotel proprietor puts the €100 note back on the counter.</p>

<p>At that moment the traveller comes down the stairs, states that the rooms are not satisfactory, picks up the €100 note, pockets the money, and leaves town.</p>

<p>No one produced anything. No one earned anything. However, the whole town is now out of debt and looking forward to a brighter future.</p>

<p>And that, gentle reader, is how a successful bailout works.</p>
