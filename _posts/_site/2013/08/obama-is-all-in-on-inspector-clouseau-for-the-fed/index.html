<p>So, <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/08/13/obamas-dangerously-heroic-view-of-the-fed/">the Obama Administration is ‘all-in’ on Summers</a>, despite nearly everyone who hasn’t worked for him (and a number who have) thinking he’s not the best candidate.</p>

<p>The argument: ‘crisis experience,’ and the need for a ‘steady hand.’</p>

<p>Summers’s <a href="http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1999/1101990215_400.jpg">crisis experience</a> is like Inspector Clouseau’s, the master detective who always seems to be at the scene of the crime.<br />

<p>You have to ask yourself, how much were his policies of fostering TBTF banks and an unstable shadow banking system to blame for the biggest financial crisis in 80+ years?</p>

<p>You want a Fed chair committed to building a simpler, more resilient financial system, not one who is going to foster more moral hazard by promising to ‘handle’ them as they arrive (with ‘liquidity puts’, bailouts, and bank subsidies).</p>

<p>There’s a time for a steady hand, and a time for a reformer, and the ‘steady hand’ who helped architect an unstable, fragile system that failed catastrophically isn’t the right guy to fix it.</p>
