[A lot of cool videos from INET&#8217;s Bretton Woods conference last week](http://ineteconomics.org/initiatives/conferences/bretton-woods/agenda). Kind of like [TED talks](http://www.ted.com/) for econ supergeeks.

  * [George Soros &#8211; Crisis averted](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Tz3Jr2EwVs#t=00m15s), Now what? The underlying imbalances are still there, but governments have stepped in. How will they ultimately get resolved?
  * [Larry Summers &#8211; the failure of regulation](http://bit.ly/gCZ6dF), as seen by former top policymaker and (de)regulator
  * [The only reason banks deem 30:1 leverage essential](http://bit.ly/hjFpyG) is their managers are paid on ROE, not risk-adjusted ROE &#8211; and when they have a state guarantee, the taxpayers are the ones taking the risk &#8211; Stanford&#8217;s Anat Admati ([her related paper](http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/research/admati.etal.html)).
  * [Wall Street has captured the government](http://bit.ly/eME8JA)&#8211; epic rant from a veteran Asian regulator Andrew Sheng ([his slides](http://ineteconomics.org/sites/inet.civicactions.net/files/BW_Presentation_Sheng_040811_EDIT.pdf))
