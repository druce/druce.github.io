A few years old, but new to me: [an interesting perspective from Yegor Gaidar](http://www.aei.org/issue/25991), reformist economist of the post-Gorbachev era.

&bull; Collectivisation and urbanization left the Soviet Union with a grain shortfall. Rather than reform the agricultural sector, they paid for food with oil exports.

&bull; In the 1985, the Saudis decided they would no longer act as swing producer and forgo exports while other members of OPEC cheated. The Saudis started a price war and broke up the cartel. Oil went briefly under $10 a barrel and Soviet oil revenue dried up.

&bull; At first the Soviets paid for food with foreign reserves, then they borrowed. But then they began to reach the limits of their credit.

&bull; Part of Gorbachev&#8217;s reforms were with the idea of becoming a country the West would lend to, even provide state guarantees in exchange for reform.

That didn&#8217;t work out too well. As Brzezinski later said, the Soviet Union could be an empire or a democracy, but not both. Once they showed weakness, everyone wanted out.
