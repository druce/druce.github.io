Medicine is high-bias, in the mathematical sense of a model that is relatively insensitive to changes in data. Like a linear model vs. a higher-order model. Medicine over-indexes on pedigrees like Harvard PhDs. It is slow to accept revolutionary ideas and then gives Nobel laureates possibly undue deference. It is slow to adapt in the face of new evidence. ["Science progresses one funeral at a time"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_principle), as explored by [Thomas Kuhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions).

For life-and-death decisions, this is usually for the better.

Science needs [falsifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability) and verifiability, or it's not science. Statistical proof is a very dull knife. For instance, it's generally accepted that cigarettes contribute to cancer, or that high cholesterol of certain kinds contributes to heart attacks. People have and maybe still do argue that medicine is wrong, it's more complex than that, that both cigarettes and cancer are downstream of e.g. stress and lifestyles and genetics that make people want to smoke. 

So you can expose lab animals to cigarettes (or high cholesterol), or to the toxins in cigarette smoke, and see what happens. You can randomly target people with anti-smoking or anti-cholesterol interventions. Complex systems are hard, like maybe the cholesterol in arteries doesn't come from dietary cholesterol but from high carb diets. But at some point, it becomes a perverse to deny some degree of causality, as calculated by [increasingly systematic methods](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X), even if it only gradually approaches the truth.

On the other hand, health influencers like Andrew Huberman, Dr. Mike, Dr. Phil, Dr. Oz ([if it quacks like a quack](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/dr-mehmet-oz-health-claims-controversial-medicare-trump-rcna181085)) probably over-index on engagement. 

But there are probably ways to synthesize, leverage all the crowdsourced data and discussions to make medicine better and more adaptable over time, and customized to different populations and individuals. Doctors should be a bit concerned how often people report that [ChatGPT does a better job](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37115527/) of listening to patients and diagnosing.

'Cultishness' and not 'engagement' might be a better description of what newer social-media movements over-index on, the health influencers, Trump and [TESCREAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TESCREAL) and bitcoin.

Unfortunately it's the story of our age. There's a lack of trust in institutions attributable to emergence of social media and collective action mechanisms. Trolls like Q and Alex Jones find the pressure points, as well as mountebanks like Oz, RFK Jr., Fox, Trump, Musk doing it opportunistically to gain wealth and power.

We really need decent folks and politicians to figure out how to do this stuff or we're doomed. AOC does an OK job, the barrage of SMS messages from ActBlue really do not. There are folks like MeidasTouch and the Krassensteins who sometimes get labeled grifters and clout chasers. But maybe every successful business is a bit of a cult or a racket, everything human that endures has an element of grift and graft. They had to sell indulgences to build the Sistine Chapel.

US democracy is pretty low-bias and high-variance. That’s what makes it boundedly responsive to voters, and to money. It also has pressure points, that folks like Putin and Murdoch and Musk figured out how to use to their benefit. Someone has to figure out how to take democracy back but I don’t really see anyone.

Of course , it was just a nut who shot at the CDC, just like it was just a not who beat Paul Pelosi with a hammer, just like it was just as nut who killed legislators in Minnesota etc., etc.

But, you know Trump did January 6, he invoked 2nd amendment solutions, he wanted to call the military out against protestors, he repeatedly said stuff like, back in the day we took care of bad people. The Army is there to shoot bad people and it's justified for righteous people to run over protestors. He refused to call Gov. Walz because he's a bad guy. His minions reshared stuff about the shooter being a Walz appointee, just like they shared stuff about Pelosi getting attacked as part of some kind of gay love triangle. Could write 10x as much on extreme right-wing violence and Trump stoking it with eliminationist rhetoric, and you know it's true.

There's an iterated prisoner's dilemma game of [building trust](https://ncase.me/trust/), and there's a one-time prisoner's dilemma game of defection, where if you have to [crash the cockpit door](https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/digital/the-flight-93-election/) and [kill the woke mind virus or else nothing else matters.](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1602278477234728960)

Of course, every election is a Flight 93 election now. So the Republicans want to redistrict Texas and do a new Census now. And some Democrats are like, OK in that case we're going to redistrict NY and California to be 90% Republican. Which is, one the one hand, OK you might have to fight fire with fire and play to win, but if one side wants to kill democracy, and they are happy to see you abandon democratic principles. You go down that road it's not much of a democracy.

There is a logic of peace which is to try to find common ground, and there is a logic of war which is to destroy the enemy before they destroy you. The side that wants to end democracy is guaranteed to win eventually. They only have to win once, unless they are stopped in a relatively final way first. [There's a reason the extreme right hates Churchill.](https://www.wsj.com/politics/why-the-far-right-hates-churchill-20fdc710?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAgJ0Vd-2KKrQSfn6gkC1byk4l8wpt50egt7i1Z-fkeu4Dfyhe-C1sIcNF9Mrbg%3D&gaa_ts=6897a3f1&gaa_sig=DbVUztaqu8_djfBklE1RmfNnXO_uGcmZVTtHFA4MyQDiqcYMd6n-rRUJi-_JqfLT7vju2fzSkLoTmgBwI776QA%3D%3D)

In my lifetime the conservatives were the high-bias party, respecting tradition and hierarchy and wealth and pedigree, standing athwart history yelling 'stop'. But now they are the party of disruption, they got hostile-taken-over by Jacobin reactionaries, and it will evolve in exactly the same way.

It will make great TV, or TikTok. In the words of the greatest Doctor, we’re all just stories in the end so make it a good one. Not one that looks fire on TikTok (literally)

In the words of [Yeats](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming):

*Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;*  
*Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,*  
*The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere*     
*The ceremony of innocence is drowned;*  
*The best lack all conviction, while the worst*     
*Are full of passionate intensity.*  
*Surely some revelation is at hand*
