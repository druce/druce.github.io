  * The Dems didn&#8217;t exactly get crushed or demolished in the Presidential. Hillary may have [won the popular vote by up to 2%.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/us-election-hillary-clinton-more-votes-popular-vote-any-candidate-barack-obama-donald-trump-a7413596.html) 
  * Trump got the fewest popular votes of any GOP candidate since W in 2000 [edit: this was based on early returns, [no longer true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016)]. Low approval. Crushed in home states that know him well. Like [Waterloo](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington), the nearest run thing you ever saw in your life. 
  * But of course Dems have gotten systematically dismantled in Congress, at the local level. 
  * Bill and Hillary Clinton moved Dems to center, curtailed redistributionist rhetoric, aligned more with elites. One would think that should have reduced political polarization and instability, right? 
  * Then GOP moved to the right, positioned as anti-elite. Picked up some poor whites. 
  * Now you have alt-right racist BS, unstable cynicism-inducing dynamic where left is the party of establishment, right anti-elite. 
  * Right positions as anti-elite while pursuing policies that in practice, as a first-order approximation, are not anti-elite at all.
  * Trump comes in and fails, Dems return to anti-elite role, restoring a more traditional left-right dynamic, with both parties now on a far more populist axis. 
  * When I say &#8216;fails&#8217;, eventually all political movements fail, sometimes they change the world and eventually peter out, sometimes they are disasters from the get-go. 
  * But frankly no one has ever been less prepared, more of a political outsider, than Trump. Reagan was a two-term governor of California, had a team of some cronies and some heavyweights, like Jim Baker (picked up from GW Bush&#8217;s team), Don Regan, George Shultz. 
  * That was the choice, the ultimate insider machine politician (who can&#8217;t even [fathom](http://www.inquisitr.com/3703979/hillary-clinton-couldnt-stop-crying-after-loss-to-trump/) why Obama didn&#8217;t handcuff Comey) against the ultimate outsider. You have chosen, [poorly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H3rdfI28s0) IMHO. 
  * You never know how a President will govern, but Trump is a real wildcard. Can he really ally with establishment Republicans and movement conservatives and cobble together an agenda that doesn&#8217;t betray his populist base? Is he really going to let Ryan and McConnell run the country, kill Obamacare, reform entitlements, privatize Medicare and lay it on him?
  * A tea-party / liberal populist coalition? Between improbable and impossible. 
  * Ineffectiveness, gridlock coupled with intensifying populist rhetoric seems a distinct possibility.
  * Finding the lost Apprentice N-word tapes and pushing Trump out seems like an avenue some on both sides of the aisle will vigorously pursue&#8230;which would inflame the populists even more.
  * On the Dem side, hard to see how anyone who follows the Clintons would not be more populist, anti-establishment like Warren or Sanders. 
  * It&#8217;s hard to be party of poor whites and poor blacks at the same time, racial resentment effs up normal right-left dynamics. More so in tough times than prosperity. 
  * But Trump seems racist enough that Dems will pick up the decent poor whites, the &#8216;non-deplorables.&#8217; When you don&#8217;t repudiate David Duke, guys who taunt reporters about sending them to the ovens, that&#8217;s pretty bad. 
  * 2-party politics is kind of like the [Hotelling problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_law), or 2 vendors on a boardwalk.
  * The beach tends to have the vanilla lovers on one side and strawberry lovers on the other.
  * The tendency will be for both vendors to position close to each other in the center. 
  * Products will tend to undifferentiate, but the one with better strawberry will be on the side with the strawberry lovers. 
  * If the two vendors perversely switch places, word might spread on one side that the strawberry is better on the other side. 
  * They walk the extra few steps, while maybe the vanilla lovers just go to the closer one. One vendor gets crushed. 
  * Or if one just has crappier product overall, everyone goes to the other. 
  * Then maybe the crappier one has to move more to the left or right, its natural side, to get any customers at all. 
  * And with 3 vendors there is no stable solution. I don&#8217;t know what happens in practice, presumably 2 pair up or one goes out of business. 
Now, I don&#8217;t identify as a liberal, I don&#8217;t like identifying as anything or joining any movements, I tend to be more of an economic realist than many liberals, but I share liberal values. I think one has to balance economic efficiency with fairness and freedom. And I&#8217;m not pleased at this election outcome.

Trump is a promoter, not an operator. He&#8217;s all id and ego, no superego. You just can&#8217;t take the politics out of politics. Like &#8220;The Wire,&#8221; &#8220;the game is the game.&#8221; The things that breed cynicism are to some degree built into the game. It&#8217;s a divided country and the things Trump had to do to get his base more excited than Hillary&#8217;s base make it impossible to hire decent people or get anything done, or at least anything that doesn&#8217;t piss off more people than it makes happy. So Trump is already running away from his campaign at top speed. 

I&#8217;m not really a believer in the &#8220;Wall Street Trump bro relief rally.&#8221; Some of his proposed policies are highly stimulative, some are highly recessionary (rolling back globalization, [tariffs](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-navarro-trump-trade-china-tariffs-20160721-snap-story.html) etc.). Crisis could come from a variety of places and the system is fragile. If Trump doesn&#8217;t bring the yuge growth and jobs and America winning that he promised, what&#8217;s next? Will he get even more populist? If he goes down, how extreme will the true populists be who come after Trump? 

I&#8217;m hoping for the best but bracing for the worst.

A few good links, don&#8217;t agree 100% with any of them but worth thinking about:

But as Trump says, &#8220;there&#8217;s something going on.&#8221; Kind of seems like we need to register Muslims because Islamic terrorists (_I said it!_), but cop-killing right-wing nuts or racist Trump supporters, that he doesn&#8217;t repudiate or mention, somehow aren&#8217;t supposed to reflect in any way on him.
