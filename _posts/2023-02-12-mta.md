MTA turnstile data is shockingly bad, in two ways.

First, ridership is down a lot, with far-reaching implications. 

And also, the data is really poor quality. You can't run a railroad with data this bad. Maybe they have something better internally. But if so, no reason to publish embarrassingly bad data.

We have data for each turnstile at 4-hour intervals. You don't always get data consistently every 4 hours though. Check out Astoria Boulevard.

The last 2 columns are this turnstile's entry and exit 'odometer'. You can see how it skips 3 days and the entry odometer count jumps by 1300. The jump suggests it's not a scenario where the station was closed for track work, they just missed collecting the data for 3 days. 

Is 4-hour granularity even adequate in this day and age of 'Internet of Things'? If you want to schedule trains during the morning rush, wouldn't you want data down to minute intervals or so? 4-hour data isn't helpful beyond scheduling the number of trains in the four-hour period.

Sometimes turnstiles randomly start counting down instead of up. Skipped data collection doesn't happen that much but this happens quite a bit.

It goes on like that for a couple of months, then starts counting up again.

One can conjecture that maintenance got done and the counter got reversed, and then eventually more maintenance got done and it got flipped back. Of course you can just take the absolute value of the difference. But there are a lot of these rollovers where you just have to drop the row.

It gets worse. The entries look significantly undercounted relative to exits.

{% include MTA/MTA_entries.html %}

Before the pandemic, exits ran 20% or so behind entries. Which makes sense, there's a big crush when a rush hour train arrives and a lot of people bypass the turnstiles and use the exit gates which don't count each exit. 

Since the pandemic, the ratio has flipped. If one rules out spontaneous generation of New Yorkers in the subway, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that entries are undercounted, and the data is just bad. Undoubtedly, [fare evasion](https://nypost.com/2022/12/05/mta-looks-to-redesign-subway-turnstiles-to-fight-fare-beating/) is on the rise, and use of exit gates is now discouraged with big signs and beeping and whatnot. But even if use of the exit gates had been eliminated, it would take like 30% fare evasion and that's not realistic.[^1]

No normal company could run their businesss with data this bad, and if you are publishing data this bad, it makes me skeptical of all your data and decisionmaking based on it.

I have been around a long time. I have infant memory of a subway [like this](https://www.phaidon.com/agenda/photography/articles/2014/december/04/how-danny-lyon-spent-new-years-eve-1966/). I grew up in [this New York](https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/g12199946/new-york-1970s/?slide=20). [The Warriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warriors_(film)) was a documentary. (Kidding, never seen it and I'm more of a French Connection/Serpico/Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 guy).

The MTA has gotten MUCH better. Almost graffiti free, AC on the trains, frequent service, pretty safe and reliable.[^2]

New York at its best is a monument to proletarian and oligarch alike.[^3] They mix in the subway. It's the city's blender and beating circulatory system. When all the races and classes are packed like sardines, people have no choice but to tolerate and get along. Car culture is the opposite, you build a little bubble to get to your gated community and personal domain where you are total master. Nothing wrong with wanting suburban paradise. But to a dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker, there's an element of self-delusion. It doesn't scale before gridlock sets in, and there isn't the opportunity for dense social networks and rich interactions. There's a reason the best and the brightest from the four corners of the world flock here.

New York is always changing, and currently it's changing in ways that make the subway less relevant.

We can see in the data that ridership dropped massively and the central business district stations dropped the most. Less clearly, one can glean that silk stocking district station dropped a little less, maybe people still go out but travel to work less. Traffic at outer statifons dropped even less as essential workers still need to work.[^4]

Some reasons the subway is becoming less relevant:
- Remote work has soared, obviously.
- Mass transit is a pandemic vector. People just don't want to take the subway as much, even when they decide to leave the confines of their apartment and go somewhere. People who can, walk, drive, hoverboard etc.
- Delivery of everything has soared v. going to Modell's or Macy's or (the late great) Century 21 or Queens Center.
- Micromobility has soared, e-bikes are everywhere, along with regular bikes, Citibikes, hoverboards, scooters, you name it. I don't worry about being stabbed any more but I worry about getting run over by an UberEats or DoorDash driver on his phone going the wrong way.
- On the horizon are self-driving vehicles + congestion pricing. I could see giving over 2 lanes on 2nd Ave to electric self-driving short buses, where you punch in where you want to go and a vehicle picks you up and takes you there. Travel times could plummet. You'll need traffic enforcers and fare-evasion enforcers and lots and lots of cameras though. 

As a dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker, it give me no pleasure to say so, but I don't think projects that need investment of upward of $100,000 per daily user, like LIRR to Grand Central and the 2nd Ave subway, the Interborough Express (more like $50k but still), are sustainable at current interest rates. It seems out of touch with reality to expect real estate to pay for those projects with taxes on new $7b office towers, when so much of the existing office space is empty. But that's where things are going, new revenue streams from property taxes and congestion pricing so essential workers can get to midtown without $10 fares.

I don't think New York as a whole is going to enter a [doom loop](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/08/nyregion/doom-loop-remote-work-pandemic-nyc.html). Soaring rents and still-strong residential demand suggest otherwie.

But the subway might be falling victim to a doom loop. Fewer riders make it less safe and service less frequent, driving more riders away, perpetuating the cycle. The system has huge debt and rates have gone up a lot. So then it has to raise fares, triggering another down cycle.

There's a doughnut effect from remote work. People can work anywhere, and a lot of (especially young) people choose New York. And a lot of people might choose low cost of living areas. Close-in commuter communities, where people lived because they wanted the house but HAD to come into the city every day, get hurt. Also if you need a database admin in Mobile, and everyone there can work remotely for companies in Austin and NYC, low cost places to do business might not be as low cost but will get an economic boost.

There's an Instagram effect. The NYSE floor is dead and ready to be converted to an event space. CNBC sends a camera around the floor and traders jerk awake for a few seconds. A few blocks away people crowd around the bull to take pictures. In both cases the real economic activity takes place online. Software is eating the world. But people still crave a sense of place and real human interaction.

That's the future of New York, for better or worse. A lot of people will still want to live here. Fewer will commute to gleaming office towers by subway.  A lot of the B class office space will get converted to residential. A lot of people are going to get around on e-bikes and scooters. 

And the sooner the MTA gets into the Internet era the less painful it will be. Both with realistic economic expectations, and modern data engineering. Any 2-bit online business has something like Mixpanel. Any normal business would go defcon 5 to get proper real-time data on their customers for capacity planning, maximizing ad revenue. Data this bad has a strong whiff of institutional rot. Seriously, get your shit together. 

*No one goes there nowadays, it's too crowded. - Yogi Berra*

[^1]: Now there has probably been a significant increase in fare evasion. Times are tough and $5.50 round trip is a lot for a kid in a low wage job. You do want to enforce it consistently. A lot of stuff is NYC is not enforced consistently. And frankly, a lot of time the cops are the worst offenders and scofflaws themselves. If you go in front of any police station you are going to see a lot of illegally parked cars with defaced plates to defeat toll collection. You can go to cops with clear evidence of a crime, like video of a guy violently harassing women or killing dogs, or Airtag evidence that your stolen bike is at a known chop shop, and you will be lucky to get them to do anything. It's a tough job and a lot of of them are professional. But the 50% of bad cops make the other 50% look bad. There's a police culture problem. Moar police at high salaries and high overtime retiring after 20 years isn't going to help. We need more specialized non-cop enforcers like the parking enforcement agents, for things like fare evasion. Sending 2-cop teams to after fare evaders is uneconomical, demoralizing for cops, and leads to bad interactions. Same for crazy/antisocial people in the subway.

[^2]: Except when you are waiting late at night at Penn and the express arrives on the local track with zero warning and you have to make a dash, miss it and wait another 10 minutes.

[^3]: Also, to civilization. To humanity. I have no truck with yokels who think 'Real Americans' are meth-heads in Appalachian hollers or semi-literate propane salesmen and don't get me started on the white supremacist Y'all Quaeda, Vanilla Isis, American Taliban, 'Who would Jesus bomb to oblivion' wackos. Which is as true a picture of the heartland as a description of New York as a blood-drenched wasteland from The Purge. Yeah, we see some of the worst of humanity sometimes. But really, the worst are the ones who waste their lives dividing people instead of building something decent. They get all outraged when you call them 'deplorable' while they run around calling you the devil and treat you like their worst enemy.

[^4]: Assuming, of course, this is not just a data artifact. Hopefully the missing entries are pretty evenly spread. If e.g. OMNY messed everything up and OMNY use is much more predominant in Manhattan, could be wrong.
