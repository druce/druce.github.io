      <h1>AI Maturity Self-Assessment</h1>
      <p>
        AI maturity measures the degree to which organizations have mastered
        AI-related capabilities to achieve operational excellence. AI maturity
        is not defined by tech tools alone, but by how effectively the
        organization can improve outcomes by orchestrating people, technology,
        data, and process.
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; margin-top: 15px">
        <li>
          <strong>Level 1 (Crawl):</strong> Initial unstructured exploration and
          planning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Level 2 (Walk):</strong> Structured learning, training,
          planning, foundation-laying, and initial POCs and pilots.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Level 3 (Run):</strong> Operational deployment at scale, with
          robust infrastructure, governance, and security, and business value
          measured against KPIs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Level 4 (Fly):</strong> An AI-native organization where AI is
          central and pervasive, deploying advanced use cases like autonomous
          agents, advanced fine-tuned models, with continuous improvement and
          adoption of emerging capabilities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      Organizations that successfully navigate AI transformation gain
      competitive advantages, operate with greater efficiency, increase velocity
      and respond faster to market changes, delivering more value creation.
