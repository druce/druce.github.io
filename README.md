druce.ai blog

<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> blog based on the brilliant <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/">Lilian Weng's Lil'Log blog</a> which uses the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">Minima</a> theme. I just tweaked a few things.

Feel free to clone it for your own machine learning blog or data science blog or other blog. But please note: _config.yml.orig to _config.yml and update front matter in there appropriately. The existing _config.yml is needed for GitHub custom domain hosting but it contains production disqus and Google analytics tags.
