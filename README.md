Jekyll blog based on <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/">Lilian Weng's Lil'Log blog</a> which uses the Minima theme.

This site uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> hosting, and is based on the brilliant <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/">Lilian Weng's Lil'Log blog</a> which uses the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">Minima</a> theme. I just tweaked a few things.

Feel free to clone it for your own machine learning or data science or other blog. You will need to rename _config.yml.orig to _config.yml and update front matter in there appropriately.
